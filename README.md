# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Set up environment variables

   Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in your Supabase credentials:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Edit `.env` and add your Supabase URL and anon key. You can get these from your [Supabase project settings](https://app.supabase.com).

3. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Build for Web

To build the project for web deployment:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `web-build` directory with static files ready for deployment.

## Deployment

This project is configured for deployment on Vercel. The `vercel.json` file specifies the build command and output directory.

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
